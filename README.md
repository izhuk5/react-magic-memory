# React + Vite â€” ðŸª„ Magic Memory ðŸª„

This project serves as an important part of my learning journey. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Net Ninja](https://www.udemy.com/user/47fd83f6-5e4a-4e87-a0f0-519ac51f91b6/) for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this study endeavor.

In a card matching game, players are presented with a grid of face-down cards, and the objective is to find matching pairs by flipping them over two at a time. Here are some key features that you might consider implementing in this React card matching game:

1. <strong>Grid Layout</strong> - Create a grid layout to display the cards. Option are 4x3.
2. <strong>Card Shuffling</strong> - Randomly shuffle the cards at the beginning of each game to ensure that the card positions are different every time.
3. <strong>Card Flipping</strong> - Allow players to click on cards to flip them over and reveal the symbols or images on the cards.
4. <strong>Matching Logic</strong> - implement the logic to check if two flipped cards match. If they match, keep them face up. If they don't, flip them back face down.
5. <strong>Score</strong> - At the bottom implement a scoring system based on the number of moves or time taken
